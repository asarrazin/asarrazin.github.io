                                    <li><b>ePub</b> [May 2020] - A website interface that offers online food ordering to a popular late night spot on the Bowdoin College campus. We conducted a user study to collect qualitative and quantitative data which informed our design and possible features to incorporate in the future. After integrating parts of the Bootstrap to our website, I worked on developing aesthetic features of the menu items on the website, as well as the "Add to Cart" capability using Javascript and CSS. I also aided in conducting a statistical analysis (paired t-test) to confirm that we had satisfied the alternate hypothesis of our project. </li>
                                    <li><b> Markov Decision Process Project </b> [May 2020] - A project that aimed to solve a more complicated version of the well-known Grid World problem, an environment in which an agent navigates the environment and chooses actions that maximize the final reward received. We used two common solution techniques to solve this MDP problem: Value Iteration and Policy Iteration. By using this Grid World problem, we explored the performance of these two algorithms and tested for the comparative performance, as well as the impact of changing factors, using these solutions. I worked on creating the transition and reward function, as well as implementing the policy iteration algorithm in Java(<a href="https://github.com/asarrazin/MDP">Github</a>).</li>
                            <li><b> Museum Navigation Mobile Application</b> - A mobile application that assists visually impaired individuals in navigating museums museums independently. I designed the user interface (in Visual Studio) and query statements to connect to the external database, which held the gallery and artwork information.</li>
                            <li><b> Predictive Keyboard</b> - A predictive word generator that uses the same principles that the human brain uses to make predicitions, employing word association models, grammar rules, and sentence topic detection. It incorporates context analysis and word association as well as basic language principles to produce word predictions that are more accurate and helpful than those produced by simple statistical mechanisms. I built this using Java. (<a href="https://github.com/asarrazin/Text-Prediction">Github</a>).</li>
                            <li><b> Let's Talk About Sex Baby - The Ethics and Impact of Sex Robots</b> - An ethics paper that explores sex robots, its current industry, and the moral drawbacks that come with the creation and implementation of these robots in society.
