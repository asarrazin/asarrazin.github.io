                    <p> Hello! My name is Anais Sarrazin and I'm a senior at Bowdoin College pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am French-Canadian, Korean American. I'm interested in understanding how new technologies are being created and their impact on society. Specifically, I'm intrigued in how human behavior and cognition are being used to advance new technologies. 
                        <br> 
                        I believe that collaboration is critical in the creation of new products and solutions. The importance of understanding what requirements the user needs are the foundation of the service and must be understood before creating the product or solution. </p>

                        I'm looking for an internship and a full-time position thereafter where I have the opportunity to apply my computer science and mathematical skills to create products and services that impact people. Iâ€™m seeking an internship  where I will have the opportunity to join a team of driven colleagues who are working to solve challenging technical problems to create new products and new customer experiences. More specifically, I am looking to become a part of an organization that understands the value of technology in driving their business and the value that collaborative environments provides in supporting these new solutions.
